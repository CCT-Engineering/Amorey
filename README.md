# Description
  - This project is designed to handle different incoming product data from an api and display their contents for an online shopping page. Data is displayed in several ways on the page for the user to interact with including an overview, related items, current outfit, ratings, and reviews.

# Installation
  - In your terminal, first run "npm install" to install all project dependencies to your local workspace
  - Next, make a copy of the "example.env" file and name it ".env". Place this file into the project's root directory
  - After you have made the .env file, you will need to create or use an already created API token from github. This token must have the following credentials: *********
  - Once you have an api token, paste it over the "mysecretpasscode" text within .env and save your file
  - Additionally, in the .env file, you can update "WEBPACK_MODE" from "development" to "production" once you want to deplot the application for users

# Reliability
  - Due to request limitations of the current api, user's should refrain from excessive server requests within a short time span to avoid temporarily getting timed out by the server
